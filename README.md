# Fitly

Fitly is a web and mobile friendly React application where users can achieve their fitness goals by inputting their current metrics and receive a custom calorie and macronutrient goal to help them do so. It will also keep them accountable by sending them a weekly reminder to input their metrics, which will then be used to calculate if their calorie goal needs to be adjusted for the following week.
